          Hi! I'm Fandi from Indonesia. I'm really passionate about programming
          and design.
        </p>
        <p>
          I first got into programming back in 2013 when I was studying at
          vocational high school. Why do I love it? Because to me, coding feels
          like playing a really fun logic game.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started getting into web development during my internship at a
          software house, where I got my first real project: building an online
          exam platform for schools.
        </p>
        <p>
          After graduating, I continued my studies in Informatics. That's where
          I discovered the world of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning,
          and Data Mining â€” challenging stuff, but incredibly interesting!
        </p>
        <p>
          Even before I officially graduated, I was already working at an
          institution that focuses on developing innovative apps and media.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, I'm mainly focusing on frontend development, while still
          learning backend to someday become a well-rounded and reliable
          software engineer.
