                Hi! I'm Fandi from Indonesia. I'm really passionate about
                programming and design.
              </p>
              <p>
                I first got into programming back in 2013 when I was studying at
                vocational high school. Why do I love it? Because to me, coding
                feels like playing a really fun logic game.
              </p>
              <p>
                I started getting into web development during my internship at a
                software house, where I got my first real project: building an
                online exam platform for schools.
              </p>
              <p>
                After graduating, I continued my studies in Informatics. That's
                where I discovered the world of Artificial Intelligence, Machine
                Learning, and Data Mining â€” challenging stuff, but incredibly
                interesting!
              </p>
              <p>
                Even before I officially graduated, I was already working at an
                institution that focuses on developing innovative apps and
                media.
              </p>
              <p>
                Right now, I'm mainly focusing on frontend development, while
                still learning backend to someday become a well-rounded and
                reliable software engineer.
